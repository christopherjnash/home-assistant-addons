# Readeck for Home Assistant

This add-on is a Home Assistant version of [Readeck](https://codeberg.org/readeck/readeck). Readeck is a lightweight, self-hosted read-it-later app that lets you save, organize, and export web content‚Äîideal for privacy-conscious users who want full control over their reading list.

This implementation is based off the version that is in [jdeath's amazing repository](https://github.com/jdeath/homeassistant-addons/tree/main). I modified it to suit my own needs (to have more specific control of the environment variables).

## üîó Usage

Once installed, access the Web UI via:
`http://<YOUR_HOME_ASSISTANT_IP>:8000/`

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

The following options are available:

- **allowed_hosts**:
  A list of hostnames or IP addresses that are allowed to access the server. Example:

- **use_x_forwarded_for** _(true/false)_:
  Enable or disable trusting the `X-Forwarded-For` header (for use behind a reverse proxy).

- **use_x_forwarded_host** _(true/false)_:
  Enable or disable trusting the `X-Forwarded-Host` header.

- **use_x_forwarded_proto** _(true/false)_:
  Enable or disable trusting the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header.

### Example configuration

```yaml
allowed_hosts:
  - readeck.domain.com
  - domain.com
  - 192.168.1.100
  - homeassistant.local
use_x_forwarded_for: true
use_x_forwarded_host: true
use_x_forwarded_proto: true
```

If you are running Readeck behind a reverse proxy or want to restrict access to certain hosts, set these options as needed in the add-on configuration panel.
