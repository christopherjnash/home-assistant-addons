# FiveFilters Full-Text RSS Add-on for Home Assistant

This add-on runs [heussd's fivefilters-full-text-rss-docker service](https://github.com/heussd/fivefilters-full-text-rss-docker) to extract and serve full article content from partial or link-only RSS feeds‚Äîall self-hosted within Home Assistant OS. 

## üîó Usage

Once installed, access the Web UI via:  
`http://<YOUR_HOME_ASSISTANT_IP>:8082/`

You can convert any feed URL to full text with: 
`http://<YOUR_HOME_ASSISTANT_IP>:8082/makefulltextfeed.php?url=<RSS_FEED_URL>`


### üß™ Example with RSS-Bridge:

Combine with RSS-Bridge for sites without proper feeds:
`http://<YOUR_HOME_ASSISTANT_IP>:8082/makefulltextfeed.php?url=http://<YOUR_RSS_BRIDGE>/rss-bridge/?action=display&bridge=HtmlSelector&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com`

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

No additional user configuration is required for basic usage. To customize parsing rules, edit the `site_config` directory inside the container (advanced users only).
